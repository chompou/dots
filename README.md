# Chompou's Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. This is a work in progress, and probably will be forever.

## Installation

No way to install anything (for now). Easiest way to copy this would just be to copy the config files you want. Don't recommend doing this blindly though, as some things are heavily personalized for my personal setup.
